# **giveME**

**giveME** is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing application designed to make sharing files as simple as generating a link. With no centralized server, this app allows users to send and receive files directly, ensuring privacy and efficiency. The project serves as a learning ground to explore **P2P networking**, **concurrency**, and **security** using Go.

## **Project Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is **self-learning**:
- **P2P Networking**: Understand how to build decentralized systems that facilitate direct communication between peers.
- **Concurrency**: Learn how to manage multiple tasks simultaneously using Go's powerful concurrency features (e.g., Goroutines, channels).
- **Security**: Explore how to securely transfer files over a P2P network, with encryption and authentication mechanisms.

---

## **Features**
- **File Sharing**: 
  - 📂 Select one or multiple files to share.
  - 🔗 Generate a shareable link that others can use to download the content.
- **Peer-to-Peer Transfer**: 
  - 🔄 Files are shared directly between peers without any central server.
- **Simple Interface**: 
  - 🖥️ Easy-to-use CLI (future GUI planned).
- **Scalable and Secure**: 
  - 🚀 Designed to handle large files and multiple connections.
  - 🔐 Incorporates encryption for secure file sharing.

---

## **As Simple As...**
1. **Select files** to share.
2. **Generate a shareable link**.
3. **Share the link** with the recipient.
4. The recipient **pastes the link** into the app to start downloading.
